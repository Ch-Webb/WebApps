				<h3>The Origin of Python</h3>
				<p>Around Christmas 1989, Van Rossum was looking for a programming project to occupy
				 himself over the time his office was closed. He decided to write an interpreter for
				 a new scripting language, that he described as a <quote>"Descendent of ABC that would
				 appeal to Unix/C Hackers."<sup><a href="references.html">[1]</a></sup></quote></p>

			<p>All of this led to the creation of "Python", a programming language which has become
			one of the forefront technologies in the current programming world, with a download rate
			of about 34 million a year<sup><a href="references.html">[2]</a></sup>, as of 2013.<br>
			Python has a range of uses, due to it's high power and ease of use. More about the advantages
			of python can be found on <a href="page3.html">the next page.</a></p>
